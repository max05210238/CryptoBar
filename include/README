This directory is intended for project header files.

A header file is a file containing C declarations and macro definitions
to be shared between several project source files. You request the use of a
header file in your project source file (C, C++, etc) located in `src` folder
by including it, with the C preprocessing directive `#include'.

```src/main.c

#include "header.h"

int main (void)
{
 ...
}
```

Including a header file produces the same results as copying the header file
into each source file that needs it. Such copying would be time-consuming
and error-prone. With a header file, the related declarations appear
in only one place. If they need to be changed, they can be changed in one
place, and programs that include the header file will automatically use the
new version when next recompiled. The header file eliminates the labor of
finding and changing all the copies as well as the risk that a failure to
find one copy will result in inconsistencies within a program.

In C, the convention is to give header files names that end with `.h'.

## CryptoBar Time Zone List (V0.97)

CryptoBar uses **integer UTC offsets** (no DST / no half-hour zones) for simplicity.

Default timezone (fresh device / after settings clear): **UTC-08 Seattle**.

### Auto Detect Time Zone (V0.97)

On a **fresh device** (when `tzIndex` is missing in NVS), after WiFi connects the firmware will attempt a
**one-time best-effort auto-detect** of the **integer UTC offset** using a public IP-based time service
(`worldtimeapi.org`). If it succeeds, it saves the detected `tzIndex` to NVS.

- If it fails (no internet / service unreachable / offset not integer), it keeps the default Seattle.
- If the user later changes Time zone manually, that stored value will always be used.
- Note: Using a VPN may cause the detected timezone to reflect the VPN exit location.

> Note: Offsets are represented by a *reference city* for user selection.
> Taiwan's UTC+08 is **Taipei** by requirement.

> UI ordering note: Internally `tzIndex` still points to `TIMEZONES[]` (kept compatible with older saves),
> but the Time zone menu is shown in UTC order using `TIMEZONE_DISPLAY_ORDER[]`.
