# CryptoBar V0.99i - Price Update Optimization

## Release Date
2025-12-21

## Overview
This release addresses price update delay issues by optimizing the API provider fallback order and implementing intelligent duplicate price detection.

## Problem Statement
Users reported experiencing 3-5 minute delays in price updates despite the device fetching prices every 30 seconds. The issue was caused by:
1. Slow API providers being used as primary data source
2. No detection mechanism for stale/cached API responses
3. Unnecessary screen refreshes when prices haven't changed

## Changes

### 1. API Provider Reordering (src/network.cpp:405-408)
**Before:** CoinPaprika → Binance → CoinGecko → Kraken
**After:** Binance → Kraken → CoinPaprika → CoinGecko

**Rationale:**
- **Binance & Kraken** are real-time exchange APIs with near-instant updates (< 5 seconds)
- **CoinPaprika & CoinGecko** are aggregator APIs with server-side caching (2-5 minute delays)

### 2. Duplicate Price Detection (src/main.cpp:355-357, 758-779)
- Tracks consecutive identical price updates
- Logs warnings when price unchanged for 3+ updates (indicates stale API data)
- Logs price changes with before/after comparison for debugging

### 3. Smart Display Refresh (src/main.cpp:802-817)
- Skips unnecessary screen refreshes when price hasn't changed
- Still refreshes every 5 updates to keep time display current
- Reduces power consumption and screen flicker

## User Benefits
1. **Faster Price Updates:** Real-time exchange APIs provide data within seconds
2. **Better Visibility:** Serial logs now show when prices are stale vs. actually unchanged
3. **Reduced Flicker:** Screen only updates when price actually changes (or every 5 updates for time)
4. **Power Savings:** Fewer unnecessary e-paper refreshes

## Serial Output Examples

### Duplicate Price Detection
```
[Price] Duplicate #1: $42150.230000 (no change)
[Price] Duplicate #2: $42150.230000 (no change)
[Price] Duplicate #3: $42150.230000 (no change)
[Price] WARNING: Price unchanged for 3 updates - possible stale API data
```

### Price Change After Duplicates
```
[Price] CHANGED after 5 duplicates: $42150.230000 -> $42165.780000
```

### Display Refresh Skip
```
[Display] Skip refresh (price unchanged, waiting for 5-update interval)
```

## Technical Details

### Price Comparison
- Uses epsilon tolerance (0.0001) for floating-point comparison
- Prevents false positives from rounding errors

### Refresh Logic
- **Price changed:** Always refresh
- **Price unchanged:** Skip refresh unless it's the 5th consecutive duplicate
- Ensures time display updates at least every 2.5 minutes (5 × 30s)

## Compatibility
- Fully backward compatible with V0.99h
- No settings changes required
- No breaking changes to user configuration

## Migration Notes
Simply flash V0.99i firmware - no additional configuration needed.
